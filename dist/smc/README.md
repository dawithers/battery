The binary in this folder was built on an M1 Macbook Pro from [hholtmann/smcFanControl]( https://github.com/hholtmann/smcFanControl ) by running:

```shell
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/hholtmann/smcFanControl.git
cd smcFanControl
make
```

Running the above command requires xcode to be installed, either fully of trough `xcode-select`.

The original license of that repository is included here as `./LICENSE`.
